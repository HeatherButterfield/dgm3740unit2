          <h3>Bahamas Cruises starting at $600</h3>
          <p>You know the name, the laid-back attitude and where to find them, but you’ll just have to visit The Bahamas to truly appreciate this classic cruise destination. On this 700-strong string of sun-splashed islands dotting the blue Atlantic, the living’s easy. (And it’s not bad on a Bahamas cruise either!) The central port of Nassau is the bustling capital of the country — “bustling” is a relative term, of course — while Freeport is all chill, all the time.</p>

          <h3>Mexico Cruises starting at $200</h3>
          <p>So close, yet so deliciously far. Mexico might be right down there, but it exists in another world entirely. Experience a whole enchilada’s worth of rich culture and fun on a cruise to Mexico. Each port — including favorites Cozumel, Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Vallarta — contributes its own distinct local flavor to the mix.</p>
